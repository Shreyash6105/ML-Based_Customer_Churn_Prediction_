# Customer Churn Prediction Projects

This repository contains **machine learning projects focused on predicting customer churn** using real-world datasets from different domains.  
Each project follows a complete ML workflow, including data understanding, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how **the same machine learning approach can be applied to different datasets**, while identifying churn-related patterns specific to each domain.

## Projects Included

### 1. Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts whether a **bank customer is likely to exit** based on demographic and account-related information such as credit score, balance, age, and activity status.

**Key points:**
- Target variable: `Exited`
- Focus on customer behavior and engagement
- Uses classification models with performance comparison using evaluation metrics

📁 Full implementation is available inside the `Bank-Customer-Churn/` folder.

### 2. Telco Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts whether a **telecom customer is likely to leave the service** based on service usage, contract type, tenure, and billing information.

**Key points:**
- Target variable: `Churn`
- Highlights the impact of contract type and tenure
- Compares multiple classification models

📁 Full implementation is available inside the `Telco-Customer-Churn/` folder.

## Common Machine Learning Workflow

Both projects follow a consistent and structured ML pipeline:

1. Data loading and understanding  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Data preprocessing and feature handling  
4. Model training using classification algorithms  
5. Model evaluation and comparison  

This approach ensures consistency while adapting to the characteristics of each dataset.
