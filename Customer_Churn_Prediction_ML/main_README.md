# Customer Churn Prediction Projects

This repository contains **machine learning projects focused on predicting customer churn** using real-world datasets from different domains.  
Each project follows a complete ML workflow, including data understanding, exploratory analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

The goal of this repository is to show how the **same machine learning approach can be applied to different datasets** while identifying churn-related patterns specific to each domain.

## Projects Included

### 1. Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts whether a **bank customer is likely to exit** based on demographic and account-related information such as credit score, balance, age, and activity status.

- Target variable: `Exited`
- Focuses on customer behavior and engagement
- Uses classification models and evaluation metrics to compare performance

### 2. Telco Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts whether a **telecom customer will leave the service** using service usage, contract type, tenure, and billing information.

- Target variable: `Churn`
- Highlights the impact of contract type and tenure
- Compares multiple classification models

## Common Workflow Followed
Across both projects, the following steps were followed:

1. Data loading and understanding  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Data preprocessing and feature handling  
4. Model training using classification algorithms  
5. Model evaluation and comparison  

This structure helps maintain consistency while adapting to different datasets.
